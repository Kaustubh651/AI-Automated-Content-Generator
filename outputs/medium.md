# Anthropic's Claude AI models experienced a major outage today, impacting products like Claude Code. Developers were seeing a 500 error when trying to use Claude Code, and Anthropic said that it was seeing elevated error rates on its APIs "across all Claude models." Anthropic quickly identified the root cause and implemented a fix within around [&#8230;]


## Section 1
The error rates were not as high as they were in the early days of Claude Code, but they were still higher than the error rate experienced by many other models. We have been able to identify a number of factors that could have caused this problem. We are not sure if they were related to the code, the code base, or the code itself. We know that the code base was not the cause, but it is possible that it was a good reason to try to fix the issue. The problem is that, when you start using Claude Code,

## Conclusion
The real impact of this shift depends on how responsibly and thoughtfully the technology is adopted.
